/// This is the entry point to the HAL API. Before you can do anything else, you
/// need to get an instance of this struct via [`Peripherals::take`] or
/// [`Peripherals::steal`].
///
/// The HAL API tracks the state of peripherals at compile-time, to prevent
/// potential bugs before the program can even run. Many parts of this
/// documentation call this "type state". The peripherals available in this
/// struct are set to their initial state (i.e. their state after a system
/// reset). See user manual, section 5.6.14.
///
/// # Safe Use of the API
///
/// Since it should be impossible (outside of unsafe code) to access the
/// peripherals before this struct is initialized, you can rely on the
/// peripheral states being correct, as long as there's no bug in the API, and
/// you're not using unsafe code to do anything that the HAL API can't account
/// for.
///
/// If you directly use unsafe code to access peripherals or manipulate this
/// API, this will be really obvious from the code. But please note that if
/// you're using other APIs to access the hardware, such conflicting hardware
/// access might not be obvious, as the other API might use unsafe code under
/// the hood to access the hardware (just like this API does).
///
/// If you do access the peripherals in any way not intended by this API, please
/// make sure you know what you're doing. In specific terms, this means you
/// should be fully aware of what your code does, and whether that is a valid
/// use of the hardware.

    /// with either other instances of `Peripherals` that exist in the program,
    /// or other means of accessing the hardware. This is only sure, if you make
    /// sure of the following:
    /// 1. No other code can access the hardware at the same time.
    /// 2. You don't change the hardware state in any way that could invalidate
    ///    the type state of other `Peripherals` instances.
    /// 3. The type state in your `Peripherals` instance matches the actual
    ///    state of the hardware.
    ///
    /// Items 1. and 2. are really tricky, so it is recommended to avoid any
    /// situations where they apply, and restrict the use of this method to
    /// situations where the program has effectively ended and the hardware will
    /// be reset right after (like a panic handler).
    ///
    /// Item 3. applies to all uses of this method, and is generally very tricky
    /// to get right. The best way to achieve that is probably to force the API
    /// into a type state that allows you to execute operations that are known
    /// to put the hardware in a safe state. Like forcing the type state for a
    /// peripheral API to the "disabled" state, then enabling it, to make sure
    /// it is enabled, regardless of wheter it was enabled before.

    /// Since there are no means within this API to forcibly change type state,
    /// you will need to resort to something like [`core::mem::transmute`].
